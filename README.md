# PrimeTriplets
In mathematics, a prime triplet is a set of three prime numbers in which the smallest and largest of the three differ by 6. In particular, the sets must have the form (p, p + 2, p + 6) or (p, p + 4, p + 6).[1] With the exceptions of (2, 3, 5) and (3, 5, 7), this is the closest possible grouping of three prime numbers, since one of every three sequential odd numbers is a multiple of three, and hence not prime (except for 3 itself). This program checks if a given number 'p' forms prime triplets or not.
